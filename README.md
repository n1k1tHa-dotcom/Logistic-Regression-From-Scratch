\# Logistic Regression from Scratch using NumPy



This project implements Logistic Regression *from scratch without using sklearn*

to predict whether a student passes or fails a DMV written exam.





Why this project?

\- Built from scratch using only NumPy

\- Shows understanding of ML math

\- Clean project structure

\- Includes training and prediction
